This is a list of the examples in this directory.

Type `make streams' to build them to Ogg/Kate streams interleaved with
video. This needs a Theora stream named video.theora.ogg in the base
directory (symlink any Theora to it, 640x480 size should be fine, dark
background suggested). This also needs either oggz_tools, or a patch
oggmerge (from ogg-tools). Both of these packages can be found at the
Xiph website: http://www.xiph.org.

Note that the oggmerge patch found in the diffs directory is needed to
merge the Kate streams to the Theora streams.

To view the resulting streams, xine needs to be patched as well. The
patch for xine is also in the diffs directory.
The Kate decoder can decode a stream back to a form that may be used
again as input to the encoder (though information like macros, etc,
will be lost).

Built streams are placed in the built-streams directory.
