This is a list of the patches to external software included in this
distribution, and a rough description of the changes. As they mature,
and the libkate API and the Kate bitstream format stabilize, they
will be contributed to the relevant projects.



 * MPlayer (mplayer-svn.diff)

This adds support for multiple Kate streams multiplexed alongside any
audio and video. Kate streams can be selected at runtime.
There is no support for Kate advanced features such as regions, styles,
and motions, only pure text is extracted and passed to the subtitle code.
In band markup is ignored.
It demuxes and uses Kate streams in both Ogg and Matroska containers.



 * xine (xine-lib-1.1.9.1-with-kate.diff)

This adds support for multiple Kate streams multiplexed alongside any
audio and video. Kate streams can be selected at runtime.
There is experimental support for almost everything Kate supports (as
xine is my testbed).
In band markup is parsed and tracked, but most of it is ignored.



 * file(1) (magic.diff)

This adds magic for Kate bitstreams, reporting bitstream version, character
encoding, language, and category.



 * ogginfo (vorbis-tools-1.2.0-with-kate.diff)

This adds support for Kate bitstreams.



 * ffmpeg2theora (ffmpeg2theora-svn-kate.diff)

This allows creating Kate streams with bitmaps from DVD style SPU subtitles.



 * libshout (libshout-2.2.2-with-kate.diff)

This adds support for Kate bitstreams.



 * mkvtoolnix (mkvtoolnix-2.1.0-kate.diff, mkvtoolnix-svn-kate.diff)

This allows Kate streams to be muxed in Matroska streams.



 * GStreamer (gst-plugins-bad-with-kate.diff, gst-plugins-good-with-kate.diff)

This adds text only Kate decoding and encoding support (eg, no styles, regions,
or motions support).



 * Annodex Mozilla browser plugin (browser_plugin-with-kate.diff)

This adds support for Kate streams as subtitles, and a simple Javascript API
to manipulate those (Linux only implementation)
