libkate itself does not require any libraries apart from the usual
system libraries (libc, etc).

Recommended prerequisites:
  libogg: available at http://www.xiph.org: for liboggkate and tools

Optional dependencies:
  liboggz or ogg-tools: to build example streams
  flex and bison: to rebuild the parser

Of course, if you want to make use of the patches to third party
software found in the diffs directory, you will need the relevant
software to which they apply as well as their dependencies.

Windows users without Cygwin or MSYS may find build files in the
contrib/build/win32 tree.

There is no configure machinery (yet).  Build with:

$ make

You may install it with one of:

$ make install PREFIX=$HOME
# make install

Uninstall with one of:

$ make uninstall PREFIX=$HOME
# make uninstall


If you do not have Flex or Bison, you will be able to build the tools,
but not to modify them.


To check that everything works correctly, you can optionally run:

$ make check


There are samples in the examples directory, see the README file there.
To build those:

$ make streams

You will need a recent version of either liboggz or ogg-tools.
You will also need a sample video to merge with, Kate-only streams will
still be created if none is available.
Built streams will be placed in the built-streams directory, one with a
single Kate stream, and another one merged with a Theora video of your
own chosing.
