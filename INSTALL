libkate itself does not require any libraries apart from the usual
system libraries (libc, etc).

Recommended prerequisites:
  libogg: available at http://www.xiph.org/: for liboggkate and tools
  libpng: available at http://www.libpng.org/: for PNG support in kateenc

Optional dependencies:
  liboggz or ogg-tools: to build example streams
  flex and bison: to rebuild the parser
  wxPython: for KateDJ

Of course, if you want to make use of the patches to third party
software found in the diffs directory, you will need the relevant
software to which they apply as well as their dependencies. Note
that the diffs directory does not ship with the tarball anymore,
and are available from the libkate git repository:
http://git.xiph.org/?p=users/oggk/kate.git;a=summary

Windows users without Cygwin or MSYS may find build files in the
contrib/build/win32 tree, for Microsoft's VC2005 and VC2008 compilers.

Build with:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

or:

$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME
$ make
$ make install

Uninstall with:

$ make uninstall


If you do not have Flex or Bison, you will be able to build the tools,
but not to modify them.


To check that everything works correctly, you can optionally run:

$ make check


There are samples in the examples directory, see the README file there.
To build those:

$ make kate-streams

Alternatively, to build Kate streams interleaved with a Theora video:

$ make streams

You will need a recent version of either liboggz or ogg-tools.
You will also need a sample video to merge with, Kate-only streams will
still be created if none is available.
Built streams will be placed in the built-streams directory, one with a
single Kate stream, and another one merged with a Theora video of your
own chosing.
