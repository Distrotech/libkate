/**

\page format_palette Format - palette

A palette definition consists of:

\li 8 bits for the number of colors in this palette minus 1 (eg, 0 means 1 color, 255 means 256 colors).

Then, for each color in the palette:

\li a \ref format_color "color".

Next, we have a \ref format_warp "warp".

Kate bitstream 0.6 makes use of this warp to add:

\li a \ref format_metadata "metadata" set.

Next, the data ends.
