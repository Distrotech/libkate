\page format_curve Format - curve

A curve definition consists of:

\li 8 bits for the curve type.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the number of points in this curve.
\li a \ref format_warp "warp".
\li 2 streams of \ref format_fp "floating point values" representing the curve.

Next, the data ends.

The points are interpreted differently for each curve type. Segments interpret these
points as segment end points, while splines interpret them as control points.
