\page format_warp Format - warp

A warp is a stream of bits along with its length, allowing to jump
over it without regard to its actual contents. Its use allows older
decoders to ignore additions to the bitstream format without having
to know about them. Warps are the main mechanism used to allow Kate
streams to maintain forward compatibility with new streams.

A warp consists of a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing
the number of data bits present in the warp, followed by that number of
bits. The actual semantics of those data bits is irrelevant to the warp,
as it acts as a container for those bits.

Jumping over a warp is simple: read the \ref format_32v "variable length integer",
and read that number of bits, discarding them. If the number of bits was zero,
this is the end of the warp. If not, there is another warp to read. This allows
the warp to be used multiple times.
