\page Format

This page documents the Kate bitstream format.

\section format-overview Overview

The Kate bitstream format consists of a number of sequential packets.
Packets can be either header packets or data packets. All header packets
must appear before any data packet.

Header packets must appear in order. Decoding of a data packet is not
possible until all header packets have been decoded.

Each Kate packet starts with a one byte type. A type with the MSB set
(eg, between 0x80 and 0xff) indicates a header packet, while a type with
the MSB cleared (eg, between 0x00 and 0x7f) indicates a data packet.
All header packets then have the Kate magic, from byte offset 1 to byte
offset 7 ("kate\0\0\0").

Since the ID header must appear first, a Kate stream can be recognized
by comparing the first eight bytes of the first packet with the signature
string "\200kate\0\0\0".

\section format-ogg-mapping Ogg mapping

The first packet in a Kate stream (always packet type 0x80, the id header
packet) must be placed on a separate page. The corresponding Ogg packet
must be marked as beginning of stream (BOS). No other packet may be
marked as BOS.

All subsequent header packets must be on one or more pages. Each data
packet must be on a separate page.

The last data packet must be the end of stream packet (packet type 0x7f).
The corresponding Ogg packet must be marked as end of stream (EOS). There
can be only one end of stream packet in a Kate stream. No other packet
may be marked as EOS.

As per the Ogg specification, granule positions must be non decreasing
within the stream. Header packets have granule position 0.

\section format-detailed Detailed description

Following is a detailed description of the format of each packet type.

Header packets:

\li \ref format_0x80 "0x80 (ID header)"
\li \ref format_0x81 "0x81 (Vorbis comments)"
\li \ref format_0x82 "0x82 (regions)"
\li \ref format_0x83 "0x83 (styles)"

Data packets:

\li \ref format_0x01 "0x01 (keepalive packet)"
\li \ref format_0x7f "0x7f (end packet)"

The remainder of the format will be documented later.

All Kate bitstream packets start with a packet identifier,
a one byte unsigned integer that identifies the type of the packet.
All header packets have the first bit set (eg, header packets have
a type byte between 0x80 and 0xff).
All data packets have the first bit cleared (eg, data packets have
a type byte between 0x00 and 0x7f).
The data following this byte is dependent on the packet type.
