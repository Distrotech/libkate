\page format_bitmap Format - bitmap

A bitmap definition consists of:

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the width of the bitmap in pixels.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the height of the bitmap in pixels.
\li 8 bits representing the number of bits per pixel for this bitmap (values not in the 0-7 range are an error).

Then, if the number of bits per pixel is zero:

\li 8 bits representing the type of the bitmap.

For type 0 (paletted bitmap):

\li 8 bits for the encoding of this bitmap

For encoding 1 (RLE encoding):

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the number of bits per pixel.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the index of the default palette to use for this bitmap (-1 if none)
\li a \ref format_rle "RLE encoded bitmap".

All other encodings are reserved. If one is encountered, the bitmap cannot be decoded.

For type 1 (PNG bitmap):

\li 32 bits for the number of bytes used for this bitmap's data.
\li That number of bytes, interpreted as a raw PNG stream.

All other types are reserved. If one is encountered, the bitmap cannot be decoded.

If the number of bits per pixel is greater than zero (deprecated):

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the index of the default palette to use for this bitmap (-1 for no default palette).
\li a stream of bits representing the pixel indices for this bitmap, rows first, packed (eg, N bits for the first pixel, N bits for the second one, etc, N being the number of bits per pixel specified above)


Next, we have a \ref format_warp "warp".

Bitstream version 0.4 starts making use of this warp:
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the horizontal offset to the logical center of the bitmap.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the vertical offset to the logical center of the bitmap.

Kate bitstream 0.6 makes further use of this warp to add:

\li a \ref format_metadata "metadata" set.

Next, the data ends.
