/**

\page format_0x83 Format - header packet type 0x83 - styles

This header contains a (possibly empty) list of predefined styles
that may be referred to by data packets.
This header is mandatory, even if no styles are predefined.

As with all headers, the first 8 bytes are composed of the header
type (0x83) and the 7 byte kate signature ("kate\0\0\0").

Next, we find a \ref format_32v "variable length integer", holding the number
of predefined styles this header contains. A negative value is an error.

Next, we find a list of \ref format_style "style" definitions, as many as defined
int the previously read number.

Next, we find a \ref format_warp "warp".

Next, the data ends.
