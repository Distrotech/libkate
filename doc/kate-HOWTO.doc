\section HOWTO-text-subtitles Text movie subtitles

Kate streams can carry Unicode text (that is, text that can represent
pretty much any existing language/script). If several Kate streams are
multiplexed along with a video, subtitles in various languages can be
made for that movie.

An easy way to create such subtitles is to use ffmpeg2theora, which
can create Kate streams from SubRip (.srt) format files, a simple but
common text subtitles format. ffmpeg2theora 0.21 or later is needed.

At its simplest:

ffmpeg2theora -o video-with-subtitles.ogg --subtitles subtitles.srt \
  video-without-subtitles.avi 

Several languages may be created and tagged with their language code
for easy selection in a media player:

ffmpeg2theora -o video-with-subtitles.ogg video-without-subtitles.avi \
  --subtitles japanese-subtitles.srt --subtitles-language ja \
  --subtitles welsh-subtitles.srt --subtitles-language cy \
  --subtitles english-subtitles.srt --subtitles-language en_GB

Alternatively, kateenc (which comes with the libkate distribution) can
create Kate streams from SubRip files as well. These can then be merged
with a video with oggz-tools:

kateenc -t srt -c subtitles -l it -o subtitles.ogg italian-subtitles.srt
oggz merge -o movie-with-subtitles.ogg movie-without-subtitles.ogg subtitles.ogg



\section HOWTO-DVD-subtitles

DVD subtitles are not text, but images. Thoggen, a DVD ripper program,
can convert these subtitles to Kate streams (at the time of writing,
Thoggen and GStreamer have not applied the necessary patches for this
to be possible out of the box, so patching them will be required).

When configuring how to rip DVD tracks, any subtitles will be detected
by Thoggen, and selecting them in the GUI will cause them to be saved as
Kate tracks along with the movie.
