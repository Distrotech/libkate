\page granule Granule encoding

Ogg leaves the encoding of granules up to a particular codec, only
mandating that granules be non decreasing with time.

The Kate bitstream format uses a linear mapping between time and
granule, described here.

A Kate granule position is composed of two different parts:
 - a base granule, in the high bits
 - a granule offset, in the low bits

\verbatim
+----------------+----------------+
| base           | offset         |
+----------------+----------------+
\endverbatim

The number of bits these parts occupy is variable, and each stream
may choose how many bits to dedicate to each. The kate_info structure
for a stream holds that information in the granule_shift field,
so each part may be reconstructed from a granulepos.

The kate_info structure for a stream also holds a rational fraction
representing the time span of granule units.

The granule rate is defined by the two fields:
\code
kate_info::gps_numerator
kate_info::gps_denominator
\endcode

The number of bits reserved for the offset is defined by the field:
\code
kate_info::granule_shift
\endcode
