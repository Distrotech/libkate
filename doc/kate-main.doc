\section Introduction

This is the documentation for libkate.

libkate is an implementation of a codec for the Kate bitstream format.

The Kate bitstream format is a timed text codec designed for embedding
in an Ogg bitstream. It was originally designed for karaoke and text.
The Kate bitstream format is documented \ref Format "here".

libkate is thread safe, with the usual caveat that a single thread
accesses a given kate stream at the same time (eg, two different
threads may use libkate at the same time, provided they access two
different streams).
