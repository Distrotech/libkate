\page format_motion Format - motion

A motion definition consists of:

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the number of curves in this motion.

Then, for each of those curves:

\li 1 bit indicating if the curve is predefined (1) or not (0).

Then, if the bit is 1:

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the index of the curve.

If the bit is 0:

\li a \ref format_curve "curve definition".

Then, in all cases:

\li a stream of \ref format_fp "floating point values" representing the lengths of those curves.
\li 8 bits for the mapping for the x coordinates.
\li 8 bits for the mapping for the y coordinates.
\li 8 bits for the semantics of this motion.
\li 1 bit for a flag representing whether this motion is periodic or not.

Next, a \ref format_warp "warp".

Kate bitstream 0.6 makes use of this warp to add:

\li a \ref format_metadata "metadata" set.

Next, the data ends.
