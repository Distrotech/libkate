\page format_metadata Format - metadata

A metadata definition consists of:

\li a bit, being 0 if the metadata set is empty, 1 otherwise.

Then, if the set is not empty:

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the number of metadata pairs present in the set.

Then, for that number:

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the number of bytes in the tag name.
\li that same number of bytes, representing the tag name. The typical C string terminating NUL is not included.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the number of bytes in the value.
\li that same number of bytes, representing the value. This value may be any stream of arbitrary data, but is
    encouraged to be UTF-8, though this is not mandatory and should not be assumed. No terminating NUL.
    Note that a terminating NUL might not make sense in the first place if the metadata contents are binary.
\li a \ref format_warp "warp".

Then, the data for this metadata pair ends.

Next, we have a \ref format_warp "warp".

Next, the data ends.
