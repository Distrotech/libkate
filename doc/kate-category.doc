\page categories Kate categories

The category field in the Kate ID header is an ASCII string meant to be
recognizable automatically (eg, it is kept as non localized ASCII). This
page lists examples of categories to use for various purposes.
It is suggested that applications recognizing well known categories such
as the ones described below may display to the user a localized version
of them (eg, when a stream has a category of "subtitles", an application
set up for the French locale might display the category as "sous-titres".

\li \c subtitles Movie (or other) subtitles, either as (possibly formatted) text, or SPU style images.

\li \c lyrics Song lyrics (typically in the language they are sung in)
