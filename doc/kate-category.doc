\page categories Kate categories

The category field in the Kate ID header is an ASCII string meant to be
recognizable automatically (eg, it is kept as non localized ASCII). This
page lists examples of categories to use for various purposes.
It is suggested that applications recognizing well known categories such
as the ones described below may display to the user a localized version
of them (eg, when a stream has a category of "subtitles", an application
set up for the French locale might display the category as "sous-titres".
If a particular category is not recognized, it may still be displayed as
a string, albeit non localized.

If using custom categories for your own use, you may use category names
prefixed by "x-". These are reserved for private use.

\li \c subtitles Movie (or other) subtitles, as (possibly formatted) text.

For instance, ffmpeg2theora can create such streams, which can be played
back by VLC, MPlayer (if patched), the Annodex browser plugin (if patched),
and any player using GStreamer (if patched).

\li \c spu-subtitles Movie (or other) subtitles, as DVD style images.

For instance, Thoggen (if patched) can create such streams, which can be
played back by VLC, and MPLayer (if patched).

\li \c lyrics Song lyrics (typically in the language they are sung in)

For instance, oggenc (if patched) can create such streams, which can be
played back by XMMS (if patched).
