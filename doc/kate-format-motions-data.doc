/**

\page format_0x85 Format - header packet type 0x85 - motions

This header contains a (possibly empty) list of predefined motions
that may be referred to by data packets.
This header is mandatory, even if no motions are predefined.

As with all headers, the first 8 bytes are composed of the header
type (0x85) and the 7 byte kate signature ("kate\0\0\0").

Next, we find a \ref format_32v "variable length integer", holding the number
of predefined motions this header contains. A negative value is an error.

Next, we find a list of \ref format_motion "motion" definitions, as many as defined
int the previously read number.

Next, we find a \ref format_warp "warp".

Next, the data ends.
