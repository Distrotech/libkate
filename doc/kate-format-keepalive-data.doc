\page format_0x01 Format - data packet type 0x01 - keepalive

Keepalive packets may be inserted at any point in a Kate stream
where a data packet may be inserted (eg, after all headers, and
before the end packet).

Keepalive packets are meant to help seeking code by placing packets
at regular intervals so a seeking program can keep track of the
granulepos without having to seek too much.

It is not mandatory to use keepalive packets, but their use may
improve seeking performance on a Kate stream with few events
when it is multiplexed with high bandwidth streams.

This packet is exactly one byte long, and consists of its packet
type byte, 0x01.
