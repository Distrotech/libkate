\page format_font_range Format - font_range

A font_range definition consists of:

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the first code point spanned by this range.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the last code point spanned by this range.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" representing the index of the first bitmap to map to the first code point.

Next, a \ref format_warp "warp".

Next, the data ends.


The bitmaps used by ranges are predefined bitmaps, and are used in order from the specified index.
