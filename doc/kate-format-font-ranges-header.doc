\page format_0x88 Format - header packet type 0x88 - font ranges

This header contains a (possibly empty) list of predefined font ranges
that may be referred to by data packets.
This header is mandatory, even if no font ranges are predefined.

As with all headers, the first 8 bytes are composed of the header
type (0x88) and the 7 byte kate signature ("kate\0\0\0").

Next, we find a \ref format_32v "variable length integer", holding the number
of predefined font ranges this header contains. A negative value is an error.

Next, we find a list of \ref format_font_range "font range" definitions, as many as defined
int the previously read number.

Next, we find a \ref format_32v "variable length integer", holding the number
of predefined font mappings this header contains. A negative value is an error.

Next, for each predefined font mapping:

\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" represented the number of
ranges in this mapping.

For each of those ranges:

\li a bit being 1 if the range is predefined, 0 if not
\li if the range is predefined, a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" being the
index of the range in the list of predefined ranges
\li if the range is not predefined, a \ref format_font_range "font range" definition.

Next, we find a \ref format_warp "warp".

Next, the data ends.
