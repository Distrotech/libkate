.BI "[\-l " language ]
.BI "[\-c " category ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B kateenc
creates Kate streams from input files (SubRip SRT subtitles, LRC lyrics, and libkate's custom description language).
When saved to an Ogg stream (the default behavior), a Kate stream may then be merged with other Ogg streams (eg, a
Theora video) using the oggz tools.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show command line help.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR
Show version information.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR
Allow simple HTML-like markup in SRT files. If this parameter is used, strings such as "<i>"
will be interpreted to mean italics, rather than appear as such. Note that various players
interpret a slightly different set of HTML tags, and some do not.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR outfile
Write the output Kate stream to the given file name (writes to stdout if not specified).
.TP
\fB\-l\fR language
Sets the language for the stream (default is the language specified in the input, or none).
.TP
\fB\-c\fR category
Sets the category for the stream (default is the category specified in the input, or none).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR serial
Sets the serial number for the output Kate stream (does not apply to raw streams).
.TP
\fB\-C\fR tag=value
Adds a comment to encode into the output Kate stream. The comment must be of the form
tag=value, and comply with the Vorbis comment rules (eg, tag is composed of a particular
subset of ASCII characters, and value is valid UTF-8). Note that you might have to escape
or quote the comment for it to be seen as a single command line parameter.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR filetype
Specifies the type of the input (srt, lrc, kate)
.TP
\fB\-R\fR threshold
Use repeat packets, with the given threshold (in seconds).
Data packets will be repeated at intervals of roughly threshold seconds, while active.
.TP
\fB\-K\fR threshold
Use keepalive packets, with the given threshold (in seconds).
Keepalive packets will be emitted when no other packet has been emitted for roughly
threshold seconds.

.SH EXAMPLES

    kateenc \-t srt \-l cy \-c SUB \-o output.ogg input.srt
