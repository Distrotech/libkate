\page format_0x81 Format - header packet type 0x81 - Vorbis comments header

The second header in a Kate stream holds Vorbis comments in the same
format as a Vorbis or Theora stream, apart from the 0x81 packet type
byte, the Kate signature, and a zero byte at the start of the packet.

As for Vorbis, note that the user comments are not necessarily NUL
terminated.

Note that, as Theora, Kate does not add a framing bit to the packet.

Refer to the documentation for Vorbis for detailed information about
the format of Vorbis comments.
