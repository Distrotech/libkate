\page format_region Format - region

A region definition consists of:

\li 8 bits for the kate_space_metric used by the x, y, w, and h values.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the x position.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the y position.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the width.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the height.
\li a \ref format_32v "variable length integer" for the default style (-1 if none).

Next, we have a \ref format_warp "warp".

Kate bitstream 0.2 makes use of this warp to add:

\li 1 bit for the clip flag.

Kate bitstream 0.6 makes further use of this warp to add:

\li a \ref format_metadata "metadata" set.

Next, the data ends.
