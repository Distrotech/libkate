KateDJ is a simple UI driven program that can extract Kate
streams from Ogg files, and merge them back in. It can be
used to make alterations to Kate streams easily, or to add
new Kate streams to an Ogg file.
Its components can also be used as simple command line tools.

KateDJ depends on oggz-tools.

Demuxing and remuxing a stream will keep the stream serial
numbers unchanged.

There are a few options available, but they are not saved,
so will be reset to the default values when the program is
run again.
