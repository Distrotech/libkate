KateDJ is a simple UI driven program that can extract Kate
streams from Ogg files, edit them, and merge them back in.
It can be used to make alterations to Kate streams easily,
or to add new Kate streams to an Ogg file.
Its components can also be used as simple command line tools.

KateDJ depends on oggz-tools.

Demuxing and remuxing a stream will keep the stream serial
numbers unchanged.
